## How to Check If a YouTube Channel Is Monetized
Method 1: Use the YouTube Monetization Checker Tool
Simply paste your YouTube channel URL into the tool above. Within seconds, you‚Äôll know if the channel is monetized. This online checker is the fastest and easiest way to verify monetization status ‚Äî no manual steps needed.

Method 2: Look for Monetization Signs Manually
Since November 17, 2023, YouTube removed the is_monetization_enabled tag from its source code. This means you can no longer check monetization status directly using browser tools.

However, some signs still suggest a channel is monetized:

The channel has a ‚ÄúJoin‚Äù button for memberships

Ads appear on multiple videos

The channel is linked with a YouTube MCN (Multi-Channel Network) or uses a CMS

The channel has over 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in the past 12 months

These indicators don‚Äôt guarantee monetization, but they strongly suggest the channel is part of the YouTube Partner Program and earning revenue.

Old Method (No Longer Works)
Before November 2023, users could check if a channel was monetized by viewing the page source and searching for is_monetization_enabled. This method was slow, technical, and often inaccurate ‚Äî especially when individual videos were monetized but the channel wasn‚Äôt fully approved.
